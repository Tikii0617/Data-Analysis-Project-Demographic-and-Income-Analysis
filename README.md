# Data Analysis Project: Demographic and Income Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing demographic information and income details of individuals, which is 32,561 rows and 15 columns. The goal is to derive insights into the demographic composition, education levels, work patterns, and income distribution within the dataset.

## Technologies Used
The analysis was performed using Python, leveraging the following libraries:
`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Utilized Pandas to load the dataset and explore its structure.
   - Investigated basic statistics, such as the shape of the dataset and data types of columns.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Preprocessed the data, including handling missing values and transforming variables.
   - Added a new feature, 'overweight,' based on BMI calculations.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created visualizations to better understand the distribution of variables.
   - Plotted bar charts to visualize the counts of categorical variables.

4. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conducted statistical analysis, including correlation heatmaps.
   - Derived insights into the relationships between different variables.

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed several key findings, including demographic distribution, average age, education levels, work patterns, and income disparities. Specific insights include:

- The dataset has a diverse racial representation, with the majority being White.
- The average age of men in the dataset is approximately 39.43 years.
- Around 16.45% of individuals have a Bachelor's degree.
- Only 2% of individuals working the fewest hours have a salary greater than 50K.
- The United States has the highest percentage of individuals with a salary greater than 50K (24.58%).
- In India, specific occupations, such as Prof-specialty and Exec-managerial, are associated with a higher likelihood of having a salary greater than 50K.
